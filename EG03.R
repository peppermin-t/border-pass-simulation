# This R code consists of a model that will help simulating the passport
# control queues, particularly on simulating cars moving through French, followed
# by British passport control at a French ferry terminal. The main function used
# for such simulation is named as "qsim".

# Model Assumptions:
# 1. There are no queues at the start of the period, i.e., nf = nb = 0
# 2. Check-in closes 30 mins before departure, i.e., no new arriving cars in the last half an hour of simulation
# 3. There are no extreme events that will affect the output, e.g., system broke down during the process
# 4. The arrival car takes 0 seconds to join the queue
#    - "queue" refers to the French queue at the start and British queue during transmission

# Constants in the qsim model:
# 1. mf is the number of french passport control stations (default: mf=5)
# 2. mb is the number of british passport control stations (default: mb=5)
# 3. maxb is the maximum british queue length (per station) (default: maxb=20)
# 4. a.rate is the probability of a car arriving each second (default: a.rate=0.1)

# Parameters in the qsim model: 
# 1. tf, the processing time for a french station is uniformly distributed between tmf and tmf+trf 
#    (default: tmf=30, trf=40)
# 2. tb, the processing time for a british station is uniformly distributed between tmb and tmb+trb 
#    (default: tmb=30, trb=40)
# # Default simulation parameters: average rate of processing passports by French and British = arrival rate (a.rate)

# For each simulation second, the output should contain:
# 1. nf: the vector of average length of french queues (measured by # cars/mf, length(nf)=7200)
# 2. nb: the vector of average length of british queues (measured by # cars/mb, length(nb)=7200)
# 3. eq: the vector of average expected waiting time for a car at the start of the french queue

# Stages: nf, nb
# We update every second for:
# 1. nf, according to a.rate and whether all british queues have reached its maximum capacity
# 2. nb, according to processing time assigned to each car and the length of British queue

# n is the number of simulated seconds. 
# In this case, we are simulating queues for 2 hours, thus n=7200

# Define "qsim" function
# Parameters are defined as above.

# Implications of small extra delays in British checking:
# The plots shown above consist of two plots with tmb=30 (by default) and the other two with tmb=40.
# We are comparing the two plots in the first row and those in the second row.
# - When the process at the british border is being delayed slightly, the processing speed in the British border is longer and queues are expected to reach its maximum capacity (maxb) faster (shown by blue plots). 
# - This will eventually impact on the processing speed in the french border as the cars are unable to proceed, causing average length of french queues to increase (shown by the red plots)
# - Therefore, the increase in the processing times in both borders will cause the increase in the expected queueing time (shown by the green plots).
